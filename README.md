# Clustering

K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithmn that is able to classify unlabeled data into groups, or clusters.

Some real-world applications include clustering songs into groups of similar pitch and amplitudes for song recommendations to users. Implemented in this notebook is the clustering of MNIST handwritten digits data.

The notebook is broken into the following sections:

1. Debugging Practice
2. K-Means Helper Functions
3. Run K-Means on Simulated Data
4. Run K-Means on MNIST Handwritten Digits Image Data
